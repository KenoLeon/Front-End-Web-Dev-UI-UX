<h2><b>Angular Who?</b></h2>

Good question, the plan is to figure out what Angular is and how it works through a series of pens that follow my learning; before each one I gave myself a little challenge which you can use to learn on your own, so come along.

 *Note: Change is coming... Angular 2 is just around the corner, but working with the current stable version of Angular 1 and then learning Angular 2 seems to be the correct path.*


 ***The General Idea with Angular***

 [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org){:target="_blank"} is a web framework for making web apps, it follows the MVC pattern which you might be familiar with and introduces it's own syntax and conventions ( Check the  [intro](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction){:target="_blank"} ), the gist of which seems to be injecting Javascript into HTML tags to add functionality, let's try the traditional Hello World to start:

 > *My/Your challenge: Import Angular, display something

 <p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="yJGoEp" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/yJGoEp/">Angular Hello World</a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
 <script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


 Easy enough,and app is declared in the JS file ( it is really a module), and then called through the ng-app - pronounced een-jee ? in the HTML section, Notice we are also running some Javascript like stuff inside the HTML, or in Angular parlance an [expression](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression){:target="_blank"}.

**Controllers**

I hope at some point to make a minimal MVC app with Angular, so looking into controllers next (albeit briefly )seems a good idea.

> *My/Your challenge: Create a controller and display something unique to that controller

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="wWROJR" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/wWROJR/">Angular Hello World Controller</a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Still sort of easy, a new concept(<b>Scope</b>) has been introduced as a way of tying a specific controller to a specific view, the view in this case is the HTML.  


**Data Binding**

Data flow in Angular seems to be a [2 way street](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding){:target="_blank"}, let's explore data binding by exchanging information from a button to a script and inversely.

> *My/Your challenge: Create a controller and a view where data is exchanged 2 ways.

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="wWNGVX" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/wWNGVX/">Angular Data Binding</a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The binding occurs both through the use of the controller in HTML ( The View) and by assigning a function within the controller to the click event, neat. You might have noticed (if not go notice it ), that the style changes by using the keyword ng-class & the button uses ng-click, these are [Angular Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive){:target="_blank"}, let's take a closer look:

**Angular Directives**


> *My/Your challenge: Use the directive ngRepeat

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="xOrLWJ" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/xOrLWJ/">Angular Directives</a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

[Angular directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive){:target="_blank"} simply add functionality to HTML, in this case a handy recursion function that you probably have written a few times. Angular comes with a bunch of **[Built in Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive)**, and you can also make your own.

**Models**

So we've covered a few core concepts, let's look into how Angular deals with the model part of MVC with a directive called ngModel

> *My/Your challenge: Use ngModel in Angular

<p data-height="420" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WxPykd" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/WxPykd/">Angular ngModel</a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

So it appears that the model in Angular is just whatever is inside a controller (the logic bits) and is bound to the HTML (The view), [ngModel ](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel){:target="_blank"}( and other directives) just make it easier to bind form/input elements to the logic inside the controller (the scope)  or in their words:
**"You can think of the view as simply an instant projection of your model."
**

**Other Bits**

This seems to be just the tip of the Angular Iceberg, I'll have to come back and revisit and expand the subject, but for now I would like to explore a few other things that jumped at me from Angular, let's start with Filters ( I used them to display  some JSON in the Cat example) :

> *My/Your challenge: Use a filter to display information.

**Filters**

<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="AXNgvA" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/AXNgvA/">Angular Filters</a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

With [FILTERS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter){:target="_blank"}, you can format data displayed on your view, there are some very handy already built in , and you can also make your own, for the previous example I just used 2 built in filters applied inside the controller ( in Javascript) and in the view as expression.

Alright, as mentioned before each aspect of Angular seems to have some nuance and complexity associated plus a ton of other intermediate and advanced features I didn't cover, check the official site if you are in a hurry,  I'll try covering more ground in the next post, but for now I hope these pens help you get started with Angular.

Best,

Keno
