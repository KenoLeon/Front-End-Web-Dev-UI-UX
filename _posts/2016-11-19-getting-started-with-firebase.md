<h3 class="fancy">Preface</h3>

I first got exposed to <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank"><b>Firebase</b></a> a few months ago during a Web Development <a href="https://www.meetup.com" target="_blank"><b>meetup</b></a>,  they were going through some changes in their API, so I decided to postpone my learning. I believe they are all settled now, so I would like to check their tasty offering: **a scalable backend API for your app**. Yum, come along as I try to make sense of what I just wrote.

<div class="challenge"> <b>Note - Challenges: </b> I gave myself little challenges you are welcome to try if you want to recreate my own learning curve.</div>

<div class="note"> <b>Note:</b>
You seem to need a google account to use firebase,permissions and data quotas are tied to that, modify your pens accordingly.

<h3 class="fancy">Let's start:</h3>

<div class="challenge"> <b>Challenge: </b>Import or use firebase with codepen</div>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="GNrrem" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="k3no" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Firebase Pt.1 " class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/k3no/pen/GNrrem/">Firebase Pt.1 </a> by Eugenio - Keno -  Leon (<a href="http://codepen.io/k3no">@k3no</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

The above web app will not work until you give it your Firebase Credentials, but once you do, it will log in an anonymous user, and allow he/she/it to upload a file to your firebase storage, the following images that show you how I set up the project were uploaded with it and are hosted by firebase, how's that for recursion !

So obviously there is a lot more going on with firebase, there are a ton of features on offer:
"Storage, Real Time Database, Authentication, Cloud Messaging, Notification, Hosting etc,etc"
And each one has it's own API/ documentation, applications and know-how.

I'll try covering some of the most interesting or useful in future posts.

Best,

Keno.
